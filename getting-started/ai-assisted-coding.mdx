# AI-Assisted Coding

Vritti projects are optimized for AI-assisted development using Claude Code and Cursor IDE.

## Claude Code

[Claude Code](https://docs.anthropic.com/claude-code) is Anthropic's CLI tool for AI-assisted coding.

### Installation

```bash
npm install -g @anthropic-ai/claude-code
```

### Usage

Navigate to any Vritti project and start Claude Code:

```bash
cd ~/Documents/Vritti/vritti-api-nexus
claude
```

### Common Commands

```bash
# Ask about the codebase
> How is authentication implemented?

# Generate code
> Create a new endpoint for user preferences

# Fix bugs
> The login flow is failing, can you investigate?

# Refactor
> Refactor the tenant service to use the repository pattern
```

### Project Context

Each Vritti project includes a `CLAUDE.md` file that provides context to Claude Code about:

- Project architecture
- Coding conventions
- Important patterns
- File structure

<Tip>
Claude Code automatically reads `CLAUDE.md` to understand project context. Keep this file updated!
</Tip>

## Cursor IDE

[Cursor](https://cursor.sh) is an AI-first IDE built on VS Code.

### Installation

Download from [cursor.sh](https://cursor.sh)

### Setup

1. Open a Vritti project in Cursor
2. The AI will automatically index the codebase
3. Use `Cmd+K` (or `Ctrl+K`) to ask questions

### Features

| Feature | Shortcut | Description |
|---------|----------|-------------|
| Chat | `Cmd+L` | Open AI chat panel |
| Edit | `Cmd+K` | AI-powered editing |
| Autocomplete | `Tab` | Accept AI suggestions |
| Explain | Select + `Cmd+L` | Explain selected code |

### Configuration

Add to `.cursor/settings.json`:

```json
{
  "cursor.contextFiles": [
    "CLAUDE.md",
    "package.json",
    "tsconfig.json"
  ]
}
```

## Best Practices

### 1. Provide Context

Be specific about what you're working on:

```bash
# Good
> I'm working on the auth module. Create a guard that validates
> onboarding tokens and checks if the user has completed email verification.

# Less helpful
> Create a guard
```

### 2. Reference Files

Point to relevant files:

```bash
> Looking at src/auth/guards/vritti-auth.guard.ts, create a similar
> guard for SSE connections that validates tokens from query params.
```

### 3. Specify Patterns

Reference existing patterns:

```bash
> Following the pattern in TenantBaseRepository, create a UserRepository
> that extends it and adds methods for finding users by email.
```

### 4. Iterate

Build up complex features step by step:

```bash
> First, let's create the DTO for the new endpoint
> Now, let's add the service method
> Finally, let's wire it up in the controller
```

## CLAUDE.md Files

Each project has a `CLAUDE.md` that serves as a guide for AI assistants.

### Structure

```markdown
# Project Name - Development Best Practices

## Project Overview
Brief description and tech stack

## Directory Structure
```
src/
├── modules/
├── common/
└── ...
```

## Critical Best Practices
Key patterns and conventions

## Common Patterns
Code examples and templates
```

### Keeping Updated

Update `CLAUDE.md` when:

- Adding new architectural patterns
- Changing conventions
- Adding important dependencies
- Discovering common mistakes

## Example Workflows

### Adding a New Feature

```bash
# 1. Understand existing patterns
> Show me how existing CRUD endpoints are structured in this project

# 2. Plan the feature
> I need to add a notifications feature. What files would I need to create?

# 3. Generate code
> Create the NotificationService following the pattern in UserService

# 4. Test
> Write unit tests for the NotificationService
```

### Debugging

```bash
# 1. Describe the issue
> Users are getting 401 errors after their session expires,
> even though they have a valid refresh token

# 2. Investigate
> Check the refresh token flow in AuthService

# 3. Fix
> The issue is that we're not checking the token binding hash. Fix it.
```

### Refactoring

```bash
# 1. Understand current state
> Analyze the current error handling approach across the codebase

# 2. Plan refactor
> How should we refactor to use RFC 7807 error responses consistently?

# 3. Execute
> Update the UserController to use the new error handling pattern
```

## Tips for Vritti Projects

### For quantum-ui

```bash
# Component generation
> Create a new Tooltip component following the Button component pattern

# Design tokens
> What color tokens are available for success states?
```

### For api-sdk

```bash
# Understanding modules
> Explain how the DatabaseModule handles multi-tenancy

# Extending functionality
> Add a new decorator for rate limiting
```

### For vritti-api-nexus

```bash
# API development
> Create a new endpoint for user preferences following REST conventions

# Database queries
> Write a Drizzle query to find users who haven't logged in for 30 days
```

### For vritti-web-nexus / vritti-auth

```bash
# React components
> Create a new settings page using quantum-ui components

# Form handling
> Add validation for the phone number field using Zod
```

## Limitations

<Warning>
AI assistants may:
- Hallucinate APIs or patterns that don't exist
- Suggest outdated approaches
- Miss project-specific conventions

Always review generated code before committing.
</Warning>
