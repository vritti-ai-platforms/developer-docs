The Vritti Cloud API provides programmatic access to authentication, user management, multi-tenancy, and onboarding features.

## Base URL

```
Development: http://localhost:3000
```

## API Versioning

All endpoints are prefixed with `/cloud-api`. The API uses URL-based versioning when breaking changes are introduced.

## Request Format

- All requests must include `Content-Type: application/json` header
- Request bodies should be JSON-encoded
- UTF-8 encoding is required

## Response Format

All responses follow a consistent JSON structure:

### Success Response
```json
{
  "data": { ... }
}
```

### Error Response (RFC 7807)
```json
{
  "type": "https://vritti.ai/errors/validation",
  "title": "Validation Error",
  "status": 400,
  "errors": [
    { "field": "email", "message": "Invalid email format" }
  ]
}
```

## Rate Limiting

API requests are rate-limited per IP address. Check response headers for rate limit info:
- `X-RateLimit-Limit`: Maximum requests per window
- `X-RateLimit-Remaining`: Remaining requests
- `X-RateLimit-Reset`: Window reset timestamp
